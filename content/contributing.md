We encourage everyone to contribute back into the project, whether by investing time
(development work, writing documentation, providing examples, etc) or by a cryptocoin contribution.

## Documentation

We know, veejay can be, eh, at times, hard to get started with. However, if you've done successfull
project using veejay, or have some tricks to share, we'd love to hear from you!

You can either contribute to the veejayhq website directly, or [contact us](/contact) on how
to approach this. The veejay website is maintained over at [github](https://github.com/veejayhq/veejayhq).

## Design work, screenshots, images of cool effects

We love samples of your work as either video or images. Let us know, and we'll give it a prominent
place on our website, or better - YOU can give it a prominent place - see the section above.

Second, we're video geeks, not design folks. Maybe you can spare us some of your frontend skills
and help out with the template for this website? let us know!

## Bitcoins

We are maintaining this project in our own time and thus have costs to maintain the development
environment and hardware. All contributions are much appreciated.
