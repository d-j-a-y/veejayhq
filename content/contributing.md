## Programming / Debugging

The veejay code used to be hosted on [Dyne](https://www.dyne.org/) : [http://code.dyne.org/veejay](http://code.dyne.org/veejay).

Since summer 2015 the source code moved to github.

You can get a copy of the source code cloning the repository :

    git clone https://github.com/c0ntrol/veejay.git

* Minor changes. When you have completed a minor changes or fixed a bug, make a [patch diff](http://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) and send it [to us](/contact/).
* Major changes. If you plan to implement a major change and want this to be included in the master, please consider to [concact us](/contact/) and talk about your project.

## Hardware 

If you are willing to send us a hardware donation, please contact us with a description of the hardware you like to give. 
Niels (the lead developer) is a collector of old (pre 1990) computer hardware and enjoys restoring and repairing old home computers in the lost evening hours.


## Documentation

You are welcome to document what you did with veejay.

The veejay website is maintained over at [github](https://github.com/veejayhq/veejayhq).

## Design work, screenshots, images of cool effects

We love samples of your work as either video or images. Let us know, and we will give it a prominent
place on our website, or better - YOU can give it a prominent place - see the section above.

Second, we are video geeks, not design folks. Maybe you can spare us some of your frontend skills
and help out with the template for this website? let us know!
