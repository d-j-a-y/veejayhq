We encourage everyone to contribute back into the project, whether by investing time (development work, writing documentation, providing examples, etc) or by a monetary contribution.
If you exploit veejay (or parts of veejay) commercially, please consider investing back into the project.

## Hardware 

If you are willing to send us a hardware donation, please contact us with a description of the hardware you like to give. 
Niels (the lead developer) is a collector of old (pre 1990) computer hardware and enjoys restoring and repairing old home computers in the lost evening hours.


## Documentation

You are welcome to document what you did with veejay.

The veejay website is maintained over at [github](https://github.com/veejayhq/veejayhq).

## Design work, screenshots, images of cool effects

We love samples of your work as either video or images. Let us know, and we'll give it a prominent
place on our website, or better - YOU can give it a prominent place - see the section above.

Second, we're video geeks, not design folks. Maybe you can spare us some of your frontend skills
and help out with the template for this website? let us know!


## The "Veejay Shop"

You can support this project by buying something from the
[Veejay shop](http://231947.spreadshirt.net)

For now, I would definately go with the mug :)

To our contributors: **Thank You!**
