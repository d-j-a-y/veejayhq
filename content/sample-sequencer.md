Its easy to sequence Samples with Reloaded - and to record the sequence to a new sample.  

This is how the Sequencer looks like:

In the 10x10 board below you have 100 slots, in each you can place exactly one sample.  
First, play the sample you want to sequence and left-mouse click one of the slots. Do  
so for the other samples you want to sequence. The grid is played from top left to  
bottom right and empty slots are simply skipped. The play pattern in the grid below is:  
1,2,3,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9  

You can click the 'Play and repeat sample grid' which will do the obvious, play the pattern.
