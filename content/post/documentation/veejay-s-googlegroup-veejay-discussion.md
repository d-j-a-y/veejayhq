I started a google-group in search of a community. The number of posts to this blog has been steady enough the last couple of months, showing the need for an alternative help channel. The group can be found here:[http://groups.google.com/group/veejay-discussion?hl=en][0]Please subscribe to this list if you have questions, and we will try our best to provide an answer.I hope the same goes for the 24 subscribers/posters/friends I have invited to get the group started!Cheers,Mathijs**p.s.**This is the original invitation as I wrote it just now:

- - -

_Hi, you’re receiving this message because you wrote a comment on the veejay blog, or have been subscribed to the veejay-users list. Veejay-users is ‘dead’ ( officially and unofficially) and I don’t hold the password to it to cancel it’s existence. The number of posts on the blog has been steady over the last couple of months, so I know there’s a need for a help channel. Because there’s no good place to ask questions about veejay, and I cannot answer all questions, I hope you will accept this invitation and maybe help out others when they come to the site for help._Thank’s for your help!<table><tbody><tr><td>
