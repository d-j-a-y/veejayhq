Veejay can (down)mix from multiple sources**Method 1/2. Mixing plain samples**To mix 'plain' samples, i.e samples with no FX you can simply add a video effect to the current sample , click it in the FX chain and select a secondary source for it from the FX sources list. This method will not render the FX that may be present on the secondary source. You can use method 2, or play and record the secondary sample to a new sample before mixing.**Method 2/2. Mixing composed samples**To mix 'composed' samples, i.e. samples with all FX rendered, you can use the MT panel in Reloaded.The MultiTrack panel is used to track multiple veejay servers and can be used to connect video streams.If you have a few fast machines and a fast network at your disposal, you can easily drive 4 veejays simultaneously.The maximum number of tracks can be increased on reloaded's command line.The MT panel provides synchronized playback controls
