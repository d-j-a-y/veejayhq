We are happy to announce the release of veejay-1.2pre1


As was stated on the list:  


    After some inactivity time, there is finally veejay 1.2  
    Most (if not all) issues that have been reported here in the  
    last few months have been resolved; most notably  
    the video streaming bug in the Multi Tracker and the previewing  
    problems with Reloaded on multi-core systems.  

    If you'r lucky, there will be source packages soon - meanwhile,  
    $ svn checkout svn://dyne.org/veejay/trunk/veejay-1.1  


Especially users on newer distro's are encouraged to upgrade, since the preview-bug ( releated to a newer relase of gdk/gtk) has been solved, along other issues
