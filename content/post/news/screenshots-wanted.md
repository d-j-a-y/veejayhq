This site could do with some more nice screenshots. Show **us** how **you** run veejay, what programs you run on the side, and what effect combo's you've created. Send us your pictures, and we'll put them up here with a thank you note and a link to your site.  

If you have the time and spirit to create some nice effect screendumps, those are welcome too. Please provide us with the name of the effect, and what settings you used to tweak the result. ( if they're nice, they might make it into a default).  

Keep in mind not to use copyrighted material as we can't use that.
