**This is veejay 1.4.1**  

*News:*  

Veejay 1.4 supports now the perspective transformation on a per-sample basis,  
You can use this feature to calibrate your camera in such way that the video  
projected corresponds with the object's position in physical space - at least,  
approximately depending on pixel to millimeter ratio's. This is great for setups like  
wall projections with interactive mirrors or floor projections with interactive water  
(try rippleTV) You can also use this feature to project the video onto an object on stage.  
This feature is in beta.
